# hello-world

idk what I'm doing, but T like it

And IM HERE! Thats truly the first step isnt it? 

Once a tattoo artist, then a fitness instructor, and soon to be a software DEV.

But here i am, not sure why i wound up here, an app idea maybe? Although the reason is irrelavant, I am quite intrigued with this challenge.

Will this challenge be just another failed attempt at a career? Or will it blossem into something beautiful, for onlytime can tell.
