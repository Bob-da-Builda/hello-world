# hello-world
idk what I'm doing 

BUT IM HERE! Thats truly the first step isnt it? 
Once a tattoo artist, then a college drop out, turned fitness instructor.
But here i am, not sure why i wound up here, an app idea maybe? Although the reason is irrelavant, I am quite intrigued with this challenge.
Will this challenge be just another failed attempt at a career? Or will it blossem into something beautiful, for onlytime can tell.
